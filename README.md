Description of the Project:
The purpose of the code is to reproduce certain results from the paper “Stability bounds on compact astrophysical objects from information-entropic measure.\
Specifically, we calculate and plot the normalized modal fraction f(|k|) for 1.2, 1.4 and 1.7  values of the polytropic index γ.\
Furthermore, we plot configurational entropy time $p0^{-1}$  and mass versus polytropic index γ.\
Finally, we display configurational entropy versus polytropic index γ. We display results for several choices of cutoff for kmin.\
All above are referred to cold white dwarfs.
